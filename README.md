# Java demos - new language features from Java 11 to Java 20

This application helps to show some new features being introduced in Java versions until Java 20.

Currently, it is being enhanced for Java JDK 20.

All relevant info is written down in comments inside sources.

## Usage
Checkout and explore in your favorite IDE.

You also can `mvn clean install` the project and then just run `java --enable-preview --add-modules=jdk.incubator.concurrent,jdk.incubator.vector -jar target\JavaDemos-2.0.jar`. 
But you may miss some important context and information without reading the comments in the source code. 

Note that `--enable-preview` and `--add-modules` options are necessary to make the newest Java language features available.
